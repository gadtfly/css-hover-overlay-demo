# css-hover-overlay-demo

Relatively terse demo of the CSS for a set of controls attached to some some content.

* Controls are attached below content by default.

* Using a (not deeply conceptually sound) media query, existing styling is conditionally extended to hover-overlay controls on top of content.

* Bonus: using [`pointer-events`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events), link on .content still clickable through overlay
